# Resources for Statistical Genetics

This repository lists resources needed for statistical genetics.

The content is mainly aimed for people starting in the field of statistical genetics. 

There are three lists:

- Available [genetic data](statgen-data.md).
- [Readings](statgen-reading.md), mostly research articles.
- [Software](statgen-software.md) to perform statistical analyses on genetic data.
- Learning material: 
  - [H3ABioNet GWAS Lecture Series 2018](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcQ0XMykNhCQJPz0amnbz9BPM4Bu0Nkgf)
  - [Lectures at the Broad Institute](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlMMtlgw6qNjROoMNTBQjAcdx53kV50cS), for example the one by [Hilary Finucane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mivyklWDtBI)
  - [GINGER](https://ginger.sph.harvard.edu/): education program for participants in East and South Africa.

I have started this collection while working on [my PhD thesis](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/FpWZlbw4Rfq20le) and hope it can be extended continuously.

If you would like to contribute to any of these lists, please make a pull request or file an [issue](https://github.com/sinarueeger/statistical-genetics-ressources/issues).
