# Resources for Statistical Genetics

This repository lists resources needed for statistical genetics.

The content is mainly aimed for people starting in the field of statistical genetics. 

There are three lists:

- Available [genetic data](statgen-data.md).
- [Readings](statgen-reading.md), mostly research articles.
- [Software](statgen-software.md) to perform statistical analyses on genetic data.

If you would like to contribute to any of these lists, please make a pull request or file an [issue](https://github.com/sinarueeger/statistical-genetics-ressources/issues).
