# Statistical Genetics Software (*in progress*)

## Categories

- 🛠️ Data quality control, handling, transformation (the tools 🛠️ representing tooling)
- 🔺 Linkage disequilibrium estimation (the tirangle 🔺 representing the lower triangle of the distance matrix)
- 📷 Principal component computation (the camera 📷 as a representation of an approximation of reality)
- ⚖️ Association tests (the scale ⚖️ representing measuring and weighing)
- 📏 Heritability estimation (the ruler 📏 representing measuring heritability)

### Imputation



## R

### Getting started
- A [tutorial](http://www.stat-gen.org/tut/tut_intro.html) for implementing a GWAS in R by the [Foulkes Lab](http://www.stat-gen.org/about.html).
- [Task view](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Genetics.html) on CRAN.
- R-packages that deal with [genetics](https://rdrr.io/search?q=genetics) or [genomics](https://rdrr.io/search?q=genomics). 

### Blogposts

- [Crafting Manhattan plots](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Manhattan_plot_in_R.html) by [Yan Holtz](https://github.com/holtzy/) for the [R graph gallery](https://www.r-graph-gallery.com/).
